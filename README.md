# Vector Types in Python3 + More

I crated three packages two of wich are sub packages requiring the first one wich is PyVectors and adds vector types to python3. The second one is PyMarching and adds a few classes to do ray marching. It is a work in progress and right now is very basic. The third one is OctaveNoise and add 1D and 2D octave noise to python3. More information on these packages is in each of the folders.
